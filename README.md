# house-price-prediction-ml


This project aims to build a real estate price prediction website. 

First, we build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com.

dataset url : [kaggle](kaggle.com/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data) 

Second  Step: We write a **python flask server** that uses the saved **model to serve http requests.** 
Third:  We built website in **html, css and javascript** that allows user to enter home **square ft area**, **bedrooms** etc and it will call python **flask server to retrieve the predicted price**.
